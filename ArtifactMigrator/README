AMEX_Audit:
Upload the artifacts to the Datameer server, using REST API. Replace the artifactType for different types of artifacts.

artifactType: connections,import-job, workbook
REST CALL: curl -u username:password -X POST -d @${filename} 'http://SERVER:PORT/rest/${artifactType}'

Connections:  
./AMEX_AUDIT/connections/6.json

ImportJobs/Datalinks:
./AMEX_AUDIT/import-job/117.json
./AMEX_AUDIT/import-job/117.json

How to Run:
1. Upload the artifacts (ALL of the above)
2. Configure the connection to point to your environment datameer database; verify it is successful by saving it.
3. Start executing the datalinks; all of them should be successful
4. Run the workbooks
	i. Audit Workbooks Sharing: This has the logic to identify shared workbooks. The last sheet Shared_workbooks has the output to identify the workbook, owner and the permissions used for sharing.
	ii. Wbk_MinHistory_GT_1: Workbooks where the minimum number of results saved is greater than 1. Best practices recommends only saving last results, unless there is a need for historical results for visualization (infographics)


Additional Updates/Future Enhancements:
- Use the WSD (workbook_sheet_data) to identify a particular column name and join it with the Audit Workbook to truly identify only shared workbooks with interested column names.
- Build historical trends
- Build infographics
